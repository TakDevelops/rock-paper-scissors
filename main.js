/* 
Understand the problem
Write a program that takes an input from a user of either rock, paper, or scissors, and plays 5 rounds of rock paper scissors with a computer. After every round, the winner is declared and a point is added to the winner

- Does program have a UI? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper
    No UI.
- What are the inputs? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
    User has to enter data when prompted, 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'
- Whatâ€™s the desired output?
    A string that declares who the winner is, and a point added to the winner
- **Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y? -** this is the pseudocode

/* 
Declare a function called computerPlay that will randomly return 'Rock, 'Paper' or 'Scissors'
Within computerPlay, create a constant variable that stores the values 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'
Randomly return 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors'
